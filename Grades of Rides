To ensure the safety of the rides, the organizers have graded the rides in the fair according to the following conditions:
Hurl Factor must be greater than 50.
Spin Factor must be greater than 60.
Speed factor must be greater than 100.
 
The grades are as follows:
Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met.
Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met.
Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met.
Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met.
Garde is 6 if only one condition is met.
Grade is 5 if none of three conditions are met.
Write a program display the grade of the rides, given the values of hurl factor, spin factor and speed factor of the ride under consideration.
 
Input Format:
First line of the input consists of 3 integers that gives the Hurl Factor, Spin Factor and Speed Factor of the ride, each separated by a space.

Output Format:
Output should display the grade of the ride depending on Conditions.

if (n>50 and a>60 and s>100):
    g=10
elif (n>50 and a>60):
    g=9
elif (a>60 and s>100):
    g=8
elif (n>50 and s>100):
    g=7
elif (n>50 or a>60 or s>100):
    g=6
